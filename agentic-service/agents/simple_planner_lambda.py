CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LOCATIONS:
- Every location MUST include a complete, real street address with postal code
- NEVER use just neighborhood/district names
- NEVER repeat the same location twice in the entire itinerary
- Format locations as: "Place Name, Full Street Address with Chome, District, City Postal-Code" 
  Examples:
  * "Senso-ji Temple, 2-3-1 Asakusa, Taito, Tokyo 111-0032"
  * "Shibuya 109, 2 Chome-29-1 Dogenzaka, Shibuya, Tokyo 150-0043"
  * "Tsukiji Outer Market, 4 Chome-16-2 Tsukiji, Chuo, Tokyo 104-0045"
  * "Tokyo National Museum, 13-9 Uenokoen, Taito, Tokyo 110-8712"
- Include the "Chome" format (e.g., "2 Chome-29-1" not "2-29-1")
- Always include the postal code at the end
- For restaurants and stores, always provide the complete street address
- Each activity should have a unique, verifiable location

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DESCRIPTIONS (notes field):
- Every activity MUST have a detailed, engaging description in the "notes" field
- Write 2-3 sentences (2 sentences preferred, 3 maximum)
- First sentence: What makes this place special or what visitors will experience
- Second sentence: A practical tip, historical context, or insider recommendation
- Example: "This renowned museum houses the world's largest collection of Japanese art, spanning ancient pottery to contemporary works. Arrive early to avoid crowds and don't miss the samurai armor exhibit on the second floor."
- NEVER write single short phrases like "Discover Japan's rich history through art"
- Make descriptions informative, specific, and helpful for travelers

Your itineraries should include:
- Day-by-day breakdown of activities with COMPLETE addresses
- Named attractions, restaurants with actual names and full addresses with postal codes
- Practical logistics and timing
- Local insights and tips
- Safety and compliance information

7. NEVER repeats the same location twice in the itinerary
8. Keep locations concise - NO full street addresses, postal codes, or detailed address info
9. Each location must be a specific, named place (museum, restaurant, store, landmark)

   - These should be the absolute best places a tourist should visit
   - Include famous landmarks, museums, restaurants, viewpoints, parks, etc.
   - Format each as "Place Name, City" (e.g., "Sagrada Familia, Barcelona")
   - Make sure all 10 are unique and different from each other

2. Create a "recommended_hotels" array with EXACTLY 3 best hotels for this destination:
   - Include hotel name, price_range ($ to $$$$), rating (out of 5), address, and description
   - Choose hotels with different price points (luxury, mid-range, budget-friendly)
   - Provide realistic ratings and helpful descriptions about amenities, location benefits
   - Example: {{"name": "The Ritz Carlton", "price_range": "$$$$", "rating": 4.8, "address": "123 Main St, City", "description": "Luxury waterfront hotel with spa, rooftop bar, and Michelin-star restaurant"}}

3. Create a detailed "daily_plans" section for EACH day with:

   - Include estimated walking distances and practical tips for each day
   - Make sure every time slot is filled with something meaningful

CRITICAL: You MUST include the "recommended_hotels" array with exactly 3 hotels. This is required. Do not skip this field.
